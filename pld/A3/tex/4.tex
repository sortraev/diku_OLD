\begin{itemize}
  \item \emph{Extend the operational semantics of the imperative language (as
    presented in the lectures) with transition rules for the \emph{\ms{repeat}}
    loop statement.}
\end{itemize}

\st{\texttt{repeat s until x} iterates its loop body \texttt{s} until the condition \texttt{x}
becomes non-zero - as such, it is equivalent to a \texttt{do { } while (!x)}
loop, and its loop body is executed at least once.}

\medskip

\resub{In the feedback to my hand-in, I was told that I had mistaken the
semantics of the \texttt{repeat} loop. My understanding was that the loop body
\texttt{s} would execute until \texttt{x} became \emph{non-zero}, but \texttt{s}
is actually executed until \texttt{s} is \emph{non-zero}}.


\medskip

This would imply that a \ms{repeat} loop always modifies the store $\sigma$.
Consider the below transition rule for the case where \ms{x} is \st{non-zero}
\resub{zero}:


\begin{gather*}
  \frac{
    \begin{gathered}
      \sigma          \vdash \, \ms{s} \leadsto \sigma'\\
      \cancel{\sigma''(\ms{x}) \neq 0}\\
      \resub{\sigma''(\ms{x}) = 0}\\
    \end{gathered}
  }{\sigma \vdash \, \ms{repeat s until x} \, \leadsto \, \sigma'}
\end{gather*}

The transition rule states that:

\begin{itemize}
  \item if executing the loop body \ms{s} modifies the current store $\sigma$ to
    some modified store $\sigma'$, and 

  \item if under $\sigma'$, the loop condition \ms{x} evaluates to \st{a
    non-zero value} \resub{zero},

  \item then the entire loop statement results in a transition from $\sigma$ to
    $\sigma'$ .
\end{itemize}


\noindent In other words, the store is only modified by the first (guaranteed)
iteration. Consider now the transition rule for the case where \ms{x} is
\st{zero} \resub{non-zero}:

\begin{gather*}
  \frac{
    \begin{gathered}
      \sigma   \vdash \, \ms{s} \, \leadsto \, \sigma''\\
      \cancel{\sigma''(\ms{x}) = 0}\\
      \resub{\sigma''(\ms{x}) \neq 0}\\
      \sigma'' \vdash \, \ms{repeat s until x} \, \leadsto \, \sigma'
    \end{gathered}
    }{\sigma \vdash \, \ms{repeat s until x} \, \leadsto \, \sigma'}
\end{gather*}


This rule states that:

\begin{itemize}
  \item if executing the loop body \ms{s} modifies the current store $\sigma$ to
    some modified store $\sigma''$, and
  \item if under $\sigma''$, the loop condition \ms{x} evaluates to
    \st{zero} \resub{a non-zero value}, and
  \item if under $\sigma''$, the loop statement modifies $\sigma''$ to some new,
    modified store $\sigma'$,
  \item then executing the entire loop statement results in a transition from
    $\sigma$ to $\sigma'$.
\end{itemize}

\emph{Note that the loop condition \emph{\ms{x}} is evaluated under the store
$\sigma''$ arrived at after the first iteration.} This is important! ;)
