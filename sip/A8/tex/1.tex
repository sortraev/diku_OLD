\section{Transformations on points clouds}

\subsection{Procrustes: Benefits of homogeneous coordinates}

Homogeneous coordinates are advantageous for Procrustes because it allows us to
concisely but explicitly describe transformations in terms of linear maps, ie.
(transformation) matrices. This is also beneficial for implementation as it
means alignment can be efficiently implemented with matrix multiplication.

\subsection{Procrustes: Degrees of freedom and minimum number of points}

There are four degrees of freedom: Two for the separate translations along the
$x$ and $y$ axes; one for the rotation; and one for the scaling (since
Procrustes uses only uniform scaling).

If $N = 1$, then we \emph{are} able to perfectly align the single point pair,
but we will have infinitely many choices for the rotation and scaling factors,
since a shape consisting of a single point that has been moved to the origin
$(0,\, 0)$ by standardization is rotationally symmetric and scaling does not
transform the origin. Hence we require $N \geq 2$ to uniquely determine the
parameters of the transformation.
