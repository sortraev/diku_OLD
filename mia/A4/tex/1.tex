\emph{This report will assume the reader is familar with basic ML, basic theory
of ANN's (including backpropagation, activation functions, etc), and
convolutions.}

% What is a neural network? an ML model comprised of a network of connected
% \emph{neurons}, organized in so-called \emph{layers}, each with its own
% associated weights and biases -- much like a set of equations. Each neuron
% outputs a value that is fed to an activation function which indicates to the
% next layer whether or not the output of this particular neuron is important.

% \subsection{Convolutional neural networks}

One major problem arises when we attempt to use ANN's with image data: Input image
data can vary greatly, and ideally we want to build a model that is robust
regardless of the placement and orientation of objects in the image. This is
called translation invariance. A CNN comes close by feeding the input image
through consecutive convolution layers, each layer producing multiple feature
maps, each map capturing different features of the image -- for example, in one
layer we might have a set of neurons in a given layer which solely detect
diagonal rounded edges, and another set which boosts and captures the contrast
between foreground and background objects -- and then feeding the result of this
through downsampling (or pooling) layers, which extract defining features and
compresses the input into an exponentially smaller map of information.

This downsampling greatly reduces computational overhead as opposed to a
regular ANN, however, a natural consequence, of course, is that we must trade
off translation invariance for -equivariance (ie. the output \emph{is}
affected by translation of the input, but the translation is similar and thus
predictable).

% \TODO{mention final FC layer!!}

Finally, as in regular networks, the resulting (multi-dimensional) feature map
output from the contracting path is fed through one or more FC layers to
generate the network prediction.
